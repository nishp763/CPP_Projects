### Purpose <a name="Purpose"></a>

Develop a program that displays the most popular URLs on the basis of a survey which was recently conducted for `N` users. For every user, you are given one URL, which they have already visited. The popularity of a URL, is directly proportional to the number of visits to that URL. The program must sort the URLs in decreasing order of popularity.

**Input Format**</br>

- First Line: `N`</br>

- Next `N` lines: String `S` (where the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> line corresponds to the URL that is visited by the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> user)
